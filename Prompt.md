# New Requirement

Help me implement a color conversion component that can convert RGB colors to HEX format. The component page has a button that, when clicked, displays a dialog with three input boxes for entering R, G, and B values respectively. Click the conversion button, and the corresponding HEX value starting with # will appear in the dialog.
